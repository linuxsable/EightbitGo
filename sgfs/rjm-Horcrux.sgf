rjm [1k\]: to this point in the game
rjm [1k\]: white has gained almost nothing at all

rjm [1k\]: you definitely need to settle those stones
Horcrux [?\]: yeah
rjm [1k\]: the first thing you should think about
rjm [1k\]: is getting out if possible, not living locally
rjm [1k\]: get out = separate white
rjm [1k\]: so getting out is worth more than living locally
rjm [1k\]: when things get real dicey like this
Horcrux [?\]: I just wanted to live

cata [2k\]: w top middle is also dead that way probably
rjm [1k\]: no you don't need to read that out, just showing you that still some things remain
rjm [1k\]: what's more important though
Horcrux [?\]: ok
rjm [1k\]: is that you should look closer
